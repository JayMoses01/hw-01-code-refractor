# Homework 01 by Jay Moses


# Modified HTML file information

File name: index.html

Changes made:
* I changed all div tags to descriptive, semantic elements like nav, section, aside, article, and footer.
* I moved the header out from the body into its own separate entity--below the head and above the body.
* I added alt tags and descriptions to all images.


# Modified CSS file information

File name: style.css

Changes made:
* I reordered all contents to match the order that they appear in the HTML file.
* I grouped the targeted elements together.
* I changed the font size for the "content" element h2's to make them smaller.
* I changed the font size for the "benefits" element h3's to make them larger. 
* I resized the font size of the footer to make the header and paragraph smaller.
